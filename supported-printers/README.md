# Supported Printers

The following guides describe in more detail how to hook up your QuadFusion to a certain printer. 

The QuadFusion is a versatile 3D print head, so it is very likely that it will be able to adapt to whatever printer you have at home. At M3D we have mounted the QuadFusion on many different types of printers. The following guide will show you how we attached the QuadFusion not only mechanically, but electrically as well.
